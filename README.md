## Git vs. GitHub
Git and Github are very similar but they aren't the same. Git is version control which is keeping 
snapshots of your code and doesn't require Github. Github keeps code in the cloud which allows you
to collaborate and also keeps track of changes in your code or other peoples code. Github requires git.

## Initial Setup
Creating a github account will allow you to keep track of changes in your code, share your files easily, 
and also collaborate with other people on Github. Github also allows you to transfer your local repository 
to your remote repository meaning that you can transfer your code into the cloud.
An SSH key is a password that allows you to clone a remote repository to your local repository and every 
key is different. 
Git config is basically setting up your user.name and user.email. This will mark the file as yours 
and you will never have to enter the information again.
