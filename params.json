Github also allows you to transfer your local repository \r\nto your remote repository meaning that you can transfer your code into the cloud.\r\nAn SSH key is a password that allows you to clone a remote repository to your local repository and every \r\nkey is different. \r\nGit config is basically setting up your user.name and user.email. This will mark the file as yours \r\nand you will never have to enter the information again. \r\n\r\n\r\n###To make a Github account\r\n1. [Click](www.github.com)\r\n2. Plug in information such as username and password\r\n3. Select the **free** plan\r\n4. _**Enjoy**_\r\n\r\n\r\n###To find your SSH key\r\n1. Log into [Github](www.github.com)\r\n2. Select SSH key in _settings_\r\n3. Click 'Add'\r\n4. Add a title and copy the key\r\n5. Open your IDE and type in 'ssh -T git@github.com' \r\n6. Type 'yes'\r\n\r\n---\r\n## Repository Setup\r\n###The repository setup is basically setting up a local repository which is your file. \r\nTo do this, you need to\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Type in mkdir (file name) in order to make a file\r\n2. 'cd' or go inside that file\r\n3. Type 'git init' which initializes and creates your first repository\r\n4. By using git config explained in _**Initial Setup**_, put in your login information\r\n5. add a new file called **readme.md**\r\n\r\n### In order to make a new repository on Github\r\n1. click 'create a new repository'\r\n2. Press 'New Repository' and add information\r\n###You should always \r\n\r\n- Save changes\r\n- use 'git add .' to add changed files\r\n- user 'git commit -m\"(message\" to display a message about your changes\r\n\r\n\r\n###A remote is used to link the repository to Github but presented.\r\n\r\n---\r\n## Workflow & Commands\r\n* 'Git Status' allows you to check what you have done to your work \r\nso you can easily pick out mistakes and fix them.\r\n\r\n* 'Git add' adds any file\r\n\r\n* 'Git commit' to explain what changes you have made\r\n'push' to push the file into a remote repository\r\n\r\n## Collaboration\r\n_Forking_ and _cloning_ is when you take someone elses uploaded file\r\nand make as many edits to it as you want. This allows people\r\nto _**collaborate**_ with each other on projects because the leader\r\nof the file gets to decide what changes to choose from.\r\nPulling is when you pull a file into your own repository to edit.\r\n\r\n## Error Handling\r\nError Handling is when you initialize the _**wrong**_ directory. \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
